# Image Classification Project: Golf, Tennis, and Table Tennis

In this project, we build a classification model using a Residual Neural Network (ResNet). The model aims to discriminate among pictures about golf, tennis, and table tennis. The dataset used in this project contains 1,500 images collected via Google Images. The model achieves an accuracy of 98.2%. Using transfer learing, we are able to train the network within a very short amount of time, i.e., a few minutes. The project can be extended to a web-based application for online image classification.
